This message announces the available of a new version of CC Mode, a
GNU Emacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++, Objective-C, and
Java code.  A list of user visible changes is available from
<http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/cc-details.html>.

Since the distribution is fairly large and since it is readily
available via the Web, anonymous ftp, and email, the source code is
not being posted here.  Downloading instructions are provided further
down in this message.

If you want to become a beta tester send subscribe requests to
cc-mode-victims-request@python.org.  If you just want announcements of
new versions, send subscribe requests to
cc-mode-announce-request@python.org.  You do not need to subscribe to
both of these lists!  These mailing lists are maintained by the
Majordomo automated mailing list software.

Getting CC Mode
===============

The canonical ftp site for the full CC Mode tar distribution is:

	<ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/emacs/cc-mode.tar.gz>

This is a gzip'd tar file containing the .el source code and
documentation, along with sundry other useful files.  See the MANIFEST
a complete list of the contained files.  You can get individual files
from the directory:

	<ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/emacs/cc-mode/>

Find out more about CC Mode on the Web:

	<http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/>

For those of you without anon-ftp access, you can use the DEC
ftpmail'er at the address ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  Send the following
message in the body of your mail to that address to get CC Mode:

reply <a valid net address back to you>
connect ftp.python.org
binary
uuencode
chdir pub/emacs
get cc-mode.tar.gz

or just send the message "help" for more information on ftpmail.
Response times will vary with the number of requests in the queue.
Note that I am in no way connected with the DEC ftpmail'er so you are
own your own with this route.
