Note, you can browse this file either as a flat, multiple page file,
or as an Emacs outline.  As a flat file, just use "C-x ]" to move
forward one page, or "C-x [" to move backward one page.  To read this
as an outline, hit "M-x outline-mode RET".  outline-mode is described
in your Emacs documentation.


* Introduction

    Welcome to cc-mode, version 4.  This is a Emacs Lisp mode for
    editing C, C++, and Objective-C in GNU Emacs.  This mode is
    decendent from c-mode.el (also called "Boring Old C Mode" or bocm
    :-), and c++-mode.el, version 2, which I have been maintaining
    since 1992.  cc-mode represents a significant milestone in the
    mode's life.  It has been fully merged back with Emacs 19's
    c-mode.el. Also a new, more intuitive and flexible mechanism for
    controlling indentation has been developed.  More on this below.

    You can now use cc-mode to edit K&R and ANSI C, most ARM C++, and
    Objective-C programs.  See below for limitations.

    In lieu of a texinfo manual (which is in the works -- volunteers
    are desperately sought!), this file will describe the following:

    	* how to get started using cc-mode
	* how to customize the new indentation engine
	* the differences between cc-mode.el and bocm c-mode.el
	* the differences between cc-mode.el and c++-mode.el.

    Note that the name of the file is cc-mode.el, and I'll often refer
    to the mode as cc-mode, but there really is no top level cc-mode
    entry point.  I call it cc-mode simply to differentiate it from
    c-mode.el.  All of the variables, commands, and functions in
    cc-mode are prefixed with c-<thing>, and c-mode, c++-mode, and
    objc-mode entry points are provided.  This file is intended to be
    a replacement for c-mode.el and c++-mode.el -- you should be able
    to remove them and dump Emacs with cc-mode.el instead.  See the
    file DUMPING for details on how to do this.

    The major version number was incremented to 4 with the addition of
    objc-mode.

    This distribution contains release 4.85 of cc-mode.  See below for
    a list of changes since the last release version 4.35.  See the
    MANIFEST for a list of files that should have been included in
    this distribution.

    XEmacs 19.11 (formerly Lucid Emacs) now comes with cc-mode.el 4.85
    dumped in the executable.  It has completely replaced c-mode.el
    and c++-mode.el.  Both XEmacs and this distribution now contain a
    new file called cc-compat.el which should ease your transition
    from bocm to cc-mode.  It comes unguaranteed and unsupported.

    Note also that I am moving to a new job!  I don't yet know what
    the state of the mailing lists will be, but for a short while, I
    expect mail will get forwarded to my new address, so please
    continue to send bug reports, add/drop messages to the old
    addresses.  I'll make the appropriate announcements to the various
    newsgroups when I know more what's going to happen.  My
    *tentative* new email address is given above.  No guarantees that
    will really be it, as I don't start the job until Sept. 19, 1994.
    Don't try sending mail there at least until after that date.


* Getting Started

    cc-mode.el works well with the 2 main branches of Emacs 19, XEmacs
    (former Lucid Emacs) and the Emacs 19 maintained by the FSF.
    FSF's Emacs 19 users will want to use Emacs version 19.21 or
    better, XEmacs/Lucid users will want 19.6 or better.  cc-mode.el
    works moderately well with Emacs 18, if you use the cc-mode-18.el
    compatibility file.  A word of warning though, Emacs 18 lacks some
    fundamental functionality that makes Emacs 18 support a losing
    battle.  Hence it is no longer supported and it is highly
    recommended that you upgrade to Emacs 19.  If you use cc-mode
    under Emacs 18, you're on your own.  With cc-mode version 5, Emacs
    18 support will be dropped altogether.

    The first thing you want to do is put cc-mode.el somewhere on your
    load-path where Emacs can find it.  Do a "C-h v load-path" to see
    all the directories Emacs looks at when loading a file.  If none
    of these directories are appropriate, create a new directory and
    add it to your load-path:

    	[in the shell]
	% cd
	% mkdir mylisp
	% mv cc-mode.el mylisp
	% cd mylisp

	[in your .emacs file add]
	(setq load-path (cons "~/mylisp" load-path))

    Next you want to byte-compile cc-mode.el.  The mode uses a lot of
    macros so if you don't byte-compile it, things will be unbearably
    slow.  YOU CAN IGNORE ALL BYTE-COMPILER WARNINGS!  They are the
    result of the multi-Emacs support and none of the warnings have
    any effect on operation. Let me say this again: YOU REALLY CAN
    IGNORE ALL BYTE-COMPILER WARNINGS!

    Here's what to do to byte-comple the file [in emacs]:

	M-x byte-compile-file RET ~/mylisp/cc-mode.el RET

    Most users will probably be running an Emacs that already has bocm
    c-mode.el dumped.  You will not want to use this, or any older
    releases of c++-mode.el if you use cc-mode.el.  If your Emacs is
    dumped with either of these files you first need to make Emacs
    "forget" about those older modes.

    If you can do a "C-h v c-mode-map" you probably need to add these
    lines at the top of your .emacs file:

        (fmakunbound 'c-mode)
    	(makunbound 'c-mode-map)
    	(fmakunbound 'c++-mode)
    	(makunbound 'c++-mode-map)
	(makunbound 'c-style-alist)

    After those lines you will want to add the following autoloads to
    your .emacs file so that cc-mode gets loaded at the right time:

    	(autoload 'c++-mode  "cc-mode" "C++ Editing Mode" t)
    	(autoload 'c-mode    "cc-mode" "C Editing Mode" t)
    	(autoload 'objc-mode "cc-mode" "Objective-C Editing Mode" t)

    Alternatively, if you want to make sure cc-mode is loaded when
    Emacs starts up, you could use this line instead of the three
    autoloads above:

    	(require 'cc-mode)

    Important note: XEmacs 19.11 already have cc-mode.el dumped in
    their Emacs, so if you are using that Emacs, do *not* add the
    *makunbound or autoload lines above!

    Next, you will want to set up Emacs so that it edits C files in
    c-mode, C++ files in c++-mode, and Objective-C files in objc-mode.
    All users (including XEmacs users) should add the following to
    your .emacs file after the autoload lines above.  Note that this
    assumes you'll be editing .h and .c files as C, .hh, .C, and .cc
    files as C++, and .m files as Objective-C. Your mileage may vary:

	(setq auto-mode-alist
	  (append '(("\\.C$"     . c++-mode)
		    ("\\.cc$"    . c++-mode)
		    ("\\.hh$"    . c++-mode)
		    ("\\.c$"     . c-mode)
		    ("\\.h$"     . c-mode)
		    ("\\.m$"  . objc-mode)
		   ) auto-mode-alist))

    You may already have some or all of these settings on your
    auto-mode-alist, but it won't hurt to put them on there again.

    That's all you need. After you've done all this, you should quit
    and restart Emacs.  The next time you visit a C, C++, or
    Objective-C file you should be using cc-mode.  You can check this
    easily by hitting "C-c C-v" in the c-mode, c++-mode, or objc-mode
    buffer.  You should see this message in the echo area:

    	Using cc-mode version 4.85


* New indentation engine

    cc-mode has a new indentation engine, providing a simplified, yet
    flexible and general mechanism for customizing indentation. It
    breaks indentation calculation into two steps. First it tries to
    figure out what kind of language construct its looking at, then it
    applies a user defined offset to the current line based on the
    type of construct it finds.

    This section will briefly cover how indentation is calculated in
    cc-mode. Only enough detail will be given so that you will know
    how to customize indentation.  Plenty of examples will be given to
    help you stylize your code, but more detailed examples will be
    left to the texinfo manual (when it is complete) and your own
    exploration.  You can also contact the help address given below.

** Step 1: Syntactic Analysis

    In the first step, cc-mode looks at the line you are currently
    indenting and tries to determine the syntactic components of the
    construct on that line.  cc-mode builds a list of these syntactic
    components, where each component on the list contains a "syntactic
    symbol" and a relative buffer position.  Syntactic symbols
    describe elements of C/C++/Objc code such as `statement',
    `substatement', `class-open', `class-close', `knr-argdecl', etc.
    You can do a "C-h v c-offsets-alist" to see the entire list of
    support syntactic symbols along with a description of the
    constructs they represent.

    Conceptually, a line of C/C++/Objc code is always indented
    relative to the indentation of some line higher up in the buffer.
    This is represented by the relative buffer positions in the
    syntactic component list.

    Here's an example. Suppose we had the following code in a c++-mode
    buffer (the line numbers don't actually appear in the buffer):

  Example 1:

    1: void swap( int& a, int& b ) 
    2: {
    3:     int tmp = a;
    4:     a = b;
    5:     b = tmp;
    6: }

    We can use the command C-c C-s (c-show-syntactic-information) to
    simply report what syntactic analysis is for a line.  If we hit
    C-c C-s on line 4, we'd see in the echo area:

        ((statement . 36))

    This tells us that the line is a statement and it is indented
    relative to buffer position 36, which happens to be the `i' in
    "int" on line 3.  If you were to move point to line 3 and hit C-c
    C-s, you would see:

    	((defun-block-intro . 30))

    This indicates that the `int' line is the first statement in a
    block, and is indented relative to buffer position 30, which is
    the brace just after the function header.

    Here's another example:

  Example 2:

    1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
    2: {
    3:     if( doit )
    4:         {
    5:             return( val + incr );
    6:         }
    7:     return( val );
    8: }

    Hitting C-c C-s on line 4 gives us:

        ((substatement-open . 46))

    which tells us that this is a brace that `opens' a substatement
    block. By the way, a `substatement' indicates the line after an
    if, else, while, do, switch, and for statements.  See the variable
    c-offsets-alist for a full description of the available syntactic
    symbols.

    Syntactic analysis lists can contain more than one element
    (i.e. cons cell), and syntactic symbols need not have relative
    buffer positions.

** Step 2: Indentation Calculation

    Indentation for the current line is calculated using the list of
    syntactic components derived in step 1 above.  Each component
    contributes to the final total indentation of the line in two
    ways.

    First, the syntactic symbol is looked up in the c-offsets-alist
    variable, which is an association list of syntactic symbols and
    the offsets to apply for those symbols.  This offset is added to
    the running total.

    Second, if the component has a relative buffer position, cc-mode
    adds the column number of that position to the running total.  By
    adding up the offsets and columns for every syntactic component on
    the list, the final total indentation for the current line is
    computed.

    Lets use our two code examples above to see how this works.  Just
    as a reminder and a convenience the code is presented again here.

  Example 1:

    1: void swap( int& a, int& b ) 
    2: {
    3:     int tmp = a;
    4:     a = b;
    5:     b = tmp;
    6: }

    Lets say point is on line 3 and we hit the TAB key to re-indent
    the line.  Remember that the syntactic component list for that
    line is:

    	((defun-block-intro . 30))

    So first cc-mode is going to look up `defun-block-intro' in the
    c-offsets-alist variable.  Lets say it find the integer `4'; it
    adds this to the running total (initialized to zero), yielding a
    running total indentation of 4 spaces.

    Next cc-mode goes to buffer position 30 and asks for the current
    column.  Since the brace at buffer position 30 is in column zero,
    it adds 0 to the running total, and since there is only one
    syntactic component on the list for this line, the total
    indentation for the line is 4 spaces.

  Example 2:

    1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
    2: {
    3:     if( doit )
    4:         {
    5:             return( val + incr );
    6:         }
    7:     return( val );
    8: }

    If we were to hit TAB on line 4 in example 2 above, the same basic
    process is performed, despite the differences in the syntactic
    component list.  Remember that the list for this line is:

        ((substatement-open . 46))

    Here, cc-mode first looks up the `substatement-open' symbol in
    c-offsets-alist, for which it might find `4'.  At this point the
    running total is 4 (0 + 4 = 4).  cc-mode then goes to buffer
    position 46, which is the `i' in "if" on line 3.  This character
    is in the fourth column on that line so adding this to the running
    total, yields an indentation for the line of 8 spaces.

    Simple, huh?

    Actually, the mode usually just does The Right Thing without you
    having to think about it in this much detail.  But when
    customizing indentation, its good to have a general idea of the
    indentation model being used.


* Customizing Indentation

    The c-offsets-alist variable is where you customize all your
    indentations.  You simply need to decide what additional offset
    you want to add for every syntactic symbol.  You can use the
    command C-c C-o (c-set-offset) as the way to set offsets, both
    interactively and from your mode hook.  Also, you can set up
    "styles" of indentation just like in standard c-mode.el.  But
    you'll probably find that most of the offsets are right for your
    style.

    In fact, the offset values in c-offsets-alist can be an integer, a
    function or variable name, or one of the following symbols: +, -,
    ++, or --, indicating positive or negative multiples of the
    variable c-basic-offset.  Thus if you like the general indentation
    levels, but you use 3 spaces instead of 4 spaces per level, you
    can probably achieve your style by just changing c-basic-offset
    like so (in your .emacs file):

    	(setq c-basic-offset 3)

    The offset value can also be a function, and this can really give
    power users a lot of flexibility in customizing indentation.

    As an example of how to customize indentation, lets change the
    style of example 2 above from:

    1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
    2: {
    3:     if( doit )
    4:         {
    5:             return( val + incr );
    6:         }
    7:     return( val );
    8: }

    to:

    1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
    2: {
    3:     if( doit )
    4:     {
    5:         return( val + incr );
    6:     }
    7:     return( val );
    8: }

    Since line 4 is the start of the construct we want to re-indent,
    we first move to that line and hit C-c C-s:

    	((substatement-open . 46))

    So we know want to change the `substatement-open' indentation.  To
    do this interactively, just hit C-c C-o.  This prompts you for the
    syntactic symbol to change, giving you a reasonable default, in
    this case, substatement-open, which is just the syntactic symbol
    we want to change!

    After you hit return cc-mode will then prompt you for the new
    offset value, with the old value as the default.  Hit backspace to
    delete the old value, then hit "0" and then return.  This moves
    the construct one level of indentation to the left.

    To check your changes quickly, just hit C-c C-q to reindent the
    entire function.  If this does what you want, you can put the
    following lisp in your c-mode-common-hook (see below for an
    example):

    	(c-set-offset 'substatement-open 0)

    You could also set up a "style" that sets this and all your
    customizations in a convenient manner.  See the variable
    c-style-alist and the command c-set-style for more information, or
    take a look at the sample .emacs file below.
    

* Frequently Asked Questions

    Q. How do I re-indent the whole file?
    A. Visit the file and hit "C-x h" to mark the whole buffer. Then
       hit "ESC C-\" to re-indent the entire region which you've just
       marked.

    Q. How do I re-indent the entire function? ESC C-x doesn't work
    A. ESC C-x is reserved for future Emacs use.  To re-indent the
       entire function hit C-c C-q.

    Q. How do I re-indent the current block?
    A. First move to the brace which opens the block with "ESC C-u",
       then re-indent that expression with "ESC C-q".

    Q. Why doesn't the RET key indent the line to where the new text
       should go after inserting the newline?
    A. Emacs' convention is that RET just add a new line, and that LFD
       adds a newline and indents.  You can make RET do this too by
       adding this to your c-mode-common-hook (see the sample .emacs
       file below):

       (define-key c-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)

       This is a very common question. :-) If you want this to be the
       default behavior, don't lobby me, lobby RMS!

    Q. I put (c-set-offset 'substatement-open 0) in my .emacs file and
       I get an error saying that c-set-offset's function definition is
       void.
    A. Since cc-mode is autoloaded, it is typically not loaded into
       your Emacs session by the time of the c-set-offset call.
       Instead of putting this in your top-level .emacs file, put the
       call to c-set-offset in your c-mode-common-hook.  See the
       sample .emacs file below for details.

* For more information

    The best thing to do at this point is poke around the source code.
    Eventually there will be an extensive texinfo manual describing
    the mode in greater detail.  Can I say this again?  Volunteers to
    help finish the manual are desperately sought!


* Requirements

    cc-mode.el requires reporter.el for submission of bug reports.
    reporter.el is distributed with the latest FSF and Lucid Emacs
    19's.  See below for Emacs Lisp Archive anonymous ftp'ing
    instructions for those of you who are using older Emacsen.


* Limitations and Known Bugs

    multi-line macros are not handled properly.

    re-indenting large regions or expressions can be slow.

    Use with Emacs 18 can be slow and annoying. You should seriously
    consider upgrading to Emacs 19.

    indentation of some nested switch constructs are known to be
    broken.

    there is still some weird behavior when filling C block comments.
    My suggestion is to check out add-on fill packages such as
    filladapt, available at the elisp archive.


* Electronic Mail

    To report bugs, use the C-c C-b (c-submit-bug-report) command.
    This provides vital information I need to reproduce your problem.
    Make sure you include a stripped down code example.

    For other help or suggestions, send a message to
    cc-mode-help@anthem.nlm.nih.gov.

    To get on the beta testers list, send an add message to
    cc-mode-victims-request@anthem.nlm.nih.gov.  Note that this is a
    fairly technical discussion list so you should be moderately Emacs
    lisp fluent and have anonymous ftp access.

    There is also an announce only list where you will get beta
    version update diffs, but will not join in the technical
    discussions.  You should still have anon-ftp, and you shouldn't
    expect beta releases to be as stable as public releases.  Send an
    add message to cc-mode-announce-request@anthem.nlm.nih.gov to be
    added to this list.

    Please use these addresses instead of my personal address so I can
    keep track of all the incoming mail!

* User visible changes since 4.35

** c-set-offset and related functions and variables can now accept
   variable symbols.  Also ++ and -- which mean 2* positive and
   negative c-basic-offset respectively.

** new variable, c-recognize-knr-p, which controls whether K&R C
   contructs will be recognized.  Trying to recognize K&R constructs
   is a time hog so if you're programming strictly in ANSI C, set this
   variable to nil (it should already be nil in c++-mode).

** new variable, c-hanging-comment-ender-p for controlling
   c-fill-paragraph's behavior.

** new syntactic symbol: statement-case-open.  This is assigned to
   lines containing an open brace just after a case/default label.

** new variable, c-progress-interval, which controls minibuffer update
   message displays during long re-indention.  This is a new feature
   which prints percentage complete messages at specified intervals.

** Better menu titles in FSF's Emacs.

** Improved selective-display compatibility.

** Bug fixes, bug fixes, bug fixes!

** Some performance enhancements, but nothing radically better.


* User visible changes since 3.349

** New major-mode: objc-mode for Objective-C editing. Also added,
   objc-mode-hook, objc-mode-abbrev-table, objc-mode-map, and
   objc-mode-syntax-table.

** New syntactic symbols objc-method-intro, objc-method-args, and
   objc-method-call-cont have been added, with appropriate offsets in
   c-offsets-alist.

** Ellemtel style puts substatement-open braces on their own line.

** Better conformance to GNU coding style. New line up function set on
   arglist-close for GNU style: c-lineup-arglist-intro-after-paren.

** bracket lists are treated like paren lists (i.e. they are given the
   appropriate arglist-* syntax).

** some changes to recognition of brace-lists. When an otherwise
   brace-list-entry or brace-list-intro is found to start with an open
   brace, the line is given brace-list-open syntax instead.

** brace-list-intro and brace-list-entry are hangable via
   c-hanging-braces-alist.

** c-set-offset provides a reasonable default in the prompt.

** various name changes to commands and variables for consistency of
   terminology.  The changes are:

   Cmd/Var   Old Name                       New Name
   -------   --------                       --------
   [var]     c-strict-semantics-p           c-strict-syntax-p
   [var]     c-echo-semantic-information-p  c-echo-syntactic-information-p
   [var]     c-semantics                    c-syntactic-context
   [cmd]     c-show-syntactic-information   c-show-syntactic-information

   some other, non-user-level name changes were effected as well

** Usual gobs of bug fixes.


* User-visible Changes Since 3.304

** You can now specify `hanginess' of close braces. See
   c-hanging-braces-alist.

** New syntactic symbol `substatement-open' to control indentation of
   braces which open a substatement block (i.e. if, for, ...).  C-c
   C-s used to call these ((block-open . ??) (substatement . ??)), but
   now they are just ((substatement-open . ??)).  WARNING: THIS CHANGE
   MAY AFFECT YOUR CURRENT INDENTATION SETTINGS.

** c-adaptive-block-open lineup function is removed. Obsoleted by
   substatement-open change above.

** New "Default" style returns indentation variables to their default
   values.

** Support for Lucid Emacs 19.10's mode-popup-menu convention.

** c-macro-expand command put on C-c C-e.

** New buffer-local variable c-comment-start-regexp. Useful for using
   cc-mode as a basis for other C-like languages.

** c++-mode handles try/catch blocks.  Assigns them `substatement'
   syntax similar to if/for/while/...

** c-indent-via-language-element renamed to c-indent-line for
   awk-mode, BOCM compatibility.

** Usual gobs of bug fixes.


* User-visible Changes Since 3.229

** Tons 'o performance enhancements.

** Tons 'o bug fixes.

** Improved support for nested structs in C.

** Emacs 18 support has been split out into a separate file,
   cc-mode-18.el. Emacs 18 support is a losing battle, so after this
   release, I am not going to actively maintain cc-mode for Emacs 18,
   although I will incorporate contributed patches to cc-mode-18.el.

** The last of the dependencies on c-mode.el should be removed.

** New syntactic symbol, defun-block-intro, which controls the
   indentation for the first line in a top-level function or class.

** c-indent-defun moved to C-c C-q

** c-scope-operator moved to C-c :

** New coding style added to c-style-alist: Ellemtel.  This supports
   the C++ coding style defined in "Programming in C++, Rules and
   Recommendations", Erik Nyquist and Mats Henricson, Ellemtel,
   ftp'able from euagate.eua.ericsson.se.

** c-set-style now modifies the global values by default. Buffer local
   versions are made when optional universal argument is given.

** New variable: c-inhibit-startup-warnings-p

** New custom indentation functions, which are not used by default:
   c-lineup-math and c-lineup-runin-statements.  The former lines up
   math statement-cont lines after the equals sign.  The latter lines
   up statement lines when the first statement in a block appears on
   the same line as the block opening brace.
