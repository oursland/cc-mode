User-visible Changes Since 3.304

* You can now specify `hanginess' of close braces (c-hanging-braces-alist).

* New syntactic symbol `substatement-open' to control indentation of
  braces which open a substatement block (i.e. if, for, ...).  C-c C-s
  used to call these ((block-open . ??) (substatement . ??)), but now
  they are just ((substatement-open . ??)).  WARNING: THIS CHANGE MAY
  AFFECT YOUR CURRENT INDENTATION SETTINGS.

* c-adaptive-block-open lineup function is removed. Obsoleted by
  substatement-open change above.

* New "Default" style returns indentation variables to their default
  values.

* Support for Lucid Emacs 19.10's mode-popup-menu convention.

* c-macro-expand command put on C-c C-e.

* New buffer-local variable c-comment-start-regexp. Useful for using
  cc-mode as a basis for other C-like languages.

* c++-mode handles try/catch blocks.  Assigns them `substatement'
  syntax similar to if/for/while/...

* c-indent-via-language-element renamed to c-indent-line for awk-mode,
  BOCM compatibility.

* Usual gobs of bug fixes.


User-visible Changes Since 3.229

* Tons 'o performance enhancements.

* Tons 'o bug fixes.

* Improved support for nested structs in C.

* Emacs 18 support has been split out into a separate file,
  cc-mode-18.el. Emacs 18 support is a losing battle, so after this
  release, I am not going to actively maintain cc-mode for Emacs 18,
  although I will incorporate contributed patches to cc-mode-18.el.

* The last of the dependencies on c-mode.el should be removed.

* New syntactic symbol, defun-block-intro, which controls the
  indentation for the first line in a top-level function or class.

* c-indent-defun moved to C-c C-q

* c-scope-operator moved to C-c :

* New coding style added to c-style-alist: Ellemtel.  This supports
  the C++ coding style defined in "Programming in C++, Rules and
  Recommendations", Erik Nyquist and Mats Henricson, Ellemtel,
  ftp'able from euagate.eua.ericsson.se.

* c-set-style now modifies the global values by default. Buffer local
  versions are made when optional universal argument is given. 

* New variable: c-inhibit-startup-warnings-p

* New custom indentation functions, which are not used by default:
  c-lineup-math and c-lineup-runin-statements.  The former lines up
  math statement-cont lines after the equals sign.  The latter lines
  up statement lines when the first statement in a block appears on
  the same line as the block opening brace.


Introduction

    Welcome to cc-mode, version 3.  This is a C and C++ editing mode
    for GNU Emacs.  This mode has its heritage from standard c-mode.el
    (also called "Boring Old C Mode" or bocm :-), and c++-mode.el,
    version 2, which I have been maintaining since 1992.  cc-mode
    represents a significant milestone in the mode's life.  It has
    been fully merged back with Emacs 19's c-mode.el. Also a new, more
    intuitive and flexible mechanism for controlling indentation has
    been developed.  More on this below.

    You can now use cc-mode to edit K&R and ANSI C, and most ARM C++
    programs.  See below for limitations.

    In lieu of a texinfo manual (which is in the works), this file
    will describe the following:

    	* how to get started using cc-mode
	* how to customize the new indentation engine
	* the differences between cc-mode.el and bocm c-mode.el
	* the differences between cc-mode.el and c++-mode.el.

    Note that the name of the file is cc-mode.el, and I'll often refer
    to the mode as cc-mode, but there really is no top level cc-mode
    entry point.  I call it cc-mode simply to differentiate it from
    c-mode.el.  All of the variables, commands, and functions in
    cc-mode are prefixed with c-<thing>, and both c-mode and c++-mode
    entry points are provided.  This file is intended to be a drop-in
    replacement for c-mode.el -- you should be able to remove
    c-mode.el and dump Emacs with cc-mode.el instead.

    Its called version 3 because of its direct lineage from
    c++-mode.el, version 2.353.


Getting Started

    cc-mode.el works with the 3 major releases of Emacs in use: Emacs
    18, FSF Emacs 19, and Lucid Emacs 19.  FSF 19 users will want
    version 19.21 or better, Lucid users will want 19.6 or better.

    The first thing you want to do is put cc-mode.el somewhere on your
    load-path where Emacs can find it.  Do a "C-h v load-path" to see
    all the directories Emacs looks at when loading a file.  If none
    of these directories are appropriate, create a new directory and
    add it to your load-path:

    	[in the shell]
	% cd
	% mkdir mylisp
	% mv cc-mode.el mylisp
	% cd mylisp

	[in your .emacs file add]
	(setq load-path (cons "~/mylisp" load-path))

    Next you want to byte-compile cc-mode.el.  The mode uses a lot of
    macros so if you don't byte-compile it, things will be unbearably
    slow.  YOU CAN IGNORE ALL BYTE-COMPILER WARNINGS!  They are the
    result of the multi-Emacs support and none of the warnings have
    any effect on operation.  Here are the steps to do this [in emacs]:

	M-x byte-compile-file RET ~/mylisp/cc-mode.el RET

    Most users will probably be running an Emacs that already has bocm
    c-mode.el dumped.  You will not want to use this, or any older
    releases of c++-mode.el if you use cc-mode.el.  If your Emacs is
    dumped with either of these files you first need to make Emacs
    "forget" about those older modes.

    If you can do a "C-h v c-mode-map" you probably need to add these
    lines at the top of your .emacs file:

        (fmakunbound 'c-mode)
    	(makunbound 'c-mode-map)
    	(fmakunbound 'c++-mode)
    	(makunbound 'c++-mode-map)
	(makunbound 'c-style-alist)

    After those lines you will want to add the following autoloads to
    your .emacs file so that cc-mode gets loaded at the right time:

    	(autoload 'c++-mode "cc-mode" "C++ Editing Mode" t)
    	(autoload 'c-mode   "cc-mode" "C Editing Mode" t)

    Next, you will want to set up Emacs so that it edits C files in
    c-mode and C++ files in c++-mode (as defined from cc-mode.el). Add
    the following to your .emacs file after the autoload lines above.
    Note that this assumes you'll be editing .h and .c files as C, and
    .hh, .C, and .cc files as C++. Your mileage may vary:

	(setq auto-mode-alist
	  (append '(("\\.C$"  . c++-mode)
		    ("\\.cc$" . c++-mode)
		    ("\\.hh$" . c++-mode)
		    ("\\.c$"  . c-mode)
		    ("\\.h$"  . c-mode)
		   ) auto-mode-alist))

    You may already have some or all of these settings on your
    auto-mode-alist, but it won't hurt to put them on there again.

    I will also briefly mention that if you have the ability to
    re-compile Emacs, you can trash c-mode.el altogether and dump
    Emacs with cc-mode.el.  If you know what this means, you probably
    already know how to do it.  If not you can contact the help
    address for more information (see below).

    That's all you need. After you've done all this, you should quit
    and restart Emacs.  The next time you visit a C or C++ file you
    should be using cc-mode.  You can check this easily by hitting
    "C-c C-v" in the c-mode or c++-mode buffer.  You should see this
    message in the echo area:

    	Using cc-mode version 3.304


New indentation engine

    cc-mode has a new indentation engine, providing a simplified, yet
    flexible and general mechanism for customizing indentation. It
    breaks indentation calculation into two steps. First it tries to
    figure out what kind of C/C++ construct its looking at, then it
    applies a user defined offset to the current line based on the
    type of construct it finds.

    This section will briefly cover how indentation is calculated in
    cc-mode. Only enough detail will be given so that you will know
    how to customize indentation.  Plenty of examples will be given to
    help you stylize your C/C++ code, but more detailed examples will
    be left to the texinfo manual (when it is complete) and your own
    exploration.  You can also contact the help address given below.

  Step 1: Syntactic Analysis

    In the first step, cc-mode looks at the line you are currently
    indenting and tries to determine the syntactic components of the
    construct on that line.  cc-mode builds a list of these syntactic
    components, where each component on the list contains a "syntactic
    symbol" and a relative buffer position.  Syntactic symbols
    describe elements of C/C++ code such as `statement',
    `substatement', `class-open', `class-close', `knr-argdecl', etc.
    You can do a "C-h v c-offsets-alist" to see the entire list of
    support syntactic symbols along with a description of the
    constructs they represent.

    Conceptually, a line of C/C++ code is always indented relative to
    the indentation of some line higher up in the buffer.  This is
    represented by the relative buffer positions in the syntactic
    component list.

    Here's an example. Suppose we had the following code in a c++-mode
    buffer (the line numbers don't actually appear in the buffer):

  Example 1:

    1: void swap( int& a, int& b ) 
    2: {
    3:     int tmp = a;
    4:     a = b;
    5:     b = tmp;
    6: }

    We can use the command C-c C-s (c-show-semantic-information) to
    simply report what syntactic analysis is for a line.  If we hit
    C-c C-s on line 4, we'd see in the echo area:

        ((statement . 36))

    This tells us that the line is a statement and it is indented
    relative to buffer position 36, which happens to be the `i' in
    "int" on line 3.  If you were to move point to line 3 and hit C-c
    C-s, you would see:

    	((defun-block-intro . 30))

    This indicates that the `int' line is the first statement in a
    block, and is indented relative to buffer position 30, which is
    the brace just after the function header.

    Here's another example:

  Example 2:

    1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
    2: {
    3:     if( doit )
    4:         {
    5:             return( val + incr );
    6:         }
    7:     return( val );
    8: }

    Hitting C-c C-s on line 4 gives us:

        ((block-open) (substatement . 46))

    which tells us 2 important things.  First, that there can be more
    than one syntactic component on the list, and second, that a
    syntactic component need not have a relative buffer position
    (e.g. block-open).  By the way, a `substatement' indicates the
    line after an if, else, while, do, switch, and for statements, and
    a `block-open' indicates a line containing an compound statement's
    block opening brace.  See the variable c-offsets-alist for a full
    description of the available syntactic symbols.

  Step 2: Indentation Calculation

    Indentation for the current line is calculated using the list of
    syntactic components derived in step 1 above.  Each component
    contributes to the final total indentation of the line in two
    ways.

    First, the syntactic symbol is looked up in the c-offsets-alist
    variable, which is an association list of syntactic symbols and
    the offsets to apply for those symbols.  This offset is added to
    the running total.

    Second, if the component has a relative buffer position, cc-mode
    adds the column number of that position to the running total.  By
    adding up the offsets and columns for every syntactic component on
    the list, the final total indentation for the current line is
    computed.

    Lets use our two code examples above to see how this works.  Just
    as a reminder and a convenience the code is presented again here.

  Example 1:

    1: void swap( int& a, int& b ) 
    2: {
    3:     int tmp = a;
    4:     a = b;
    5:     b = tmp;
    6: }

    Lets say point is on line 3 and we hit the TAB key to re-indent
    the line.  Remember that the syntactic component list for that
    line is:

    	((defun-block-intro . 30))

    So first cc-mode is going to look up `defun-block-intro' in the
    c-offsets-alist variable.  Lets say it find the integer `4'; it
    adds this to the running total (initialized to zero), yielding a
    running total indentation of 4 spaces.

    Next cc-mode goes to buffer position 30 and asks for the current
    column.  Since the brace at buffer position 30 is in column zero,
    it adds 0 to the running total, and since there is only one
    syntactic component on the list for this line, the total
    indentation for the line is 4 spaces.

  Example 2:

    1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
    2: {
    3:     if( doit )
    4:         {
    5:             return( val + incr );
    6:         }
    7:     return( val );
    8: }

    If we were to hit TAB on line 4 in example 2 above, the same basic
    process is performed, despite the differences in the syntactic
    component list.  Remember that the list for this line is:

        ((block-open) (substatement . 46))
    
    Here, cc-mode first looks up the `block-open' symbol in
    c-offsets-alist, for which it finds `0'.  At this point the
    running total is still zero (0 + 0 = 0).  And since the block-open
    component has no buffer relative position, cc-mode is done
    processing this syntactic component, so it just moves on to the
    next component on the list.

    It then looks up `substatement', for which it might find `4'.
    Adding this to the running total yields a total indentation of 4
    spaces.  cc-mode then goes to buffer position 46, which is the `i'
    in "if" on line 3.  This character is in the fourth column on that
    line so adding this to the running total, yields an indentation
    for the line of 8 spaces.

    Simple, huh?

    Actually, the mode usually just does The Right Thing without you
    having to think about it in this much detail.  But when
    customizing indentation, its good to have a general idea of the
    indentation model being used.


Customizing Indentation

    The c-offsets-alist variable is where you customize all your
    indentations.  You simply need to decide what additional offset
    you want to add for every syntactic symbol.  You can use the
    command C-c C-o (c-set-offset) as the way to set offsets, both
    interactively and from your mode hook.  Also, you can set up
    "styles" of indentation just like in standard c-mode.el.  But
    you'll probably find that most of the offsets are right for your
    style.

    In fact, the offset values in c-offsets-alist can be an integer,
    or it can be one of the symbols `+' or `-' indicating positive or
    negative multiples of the variable c-basic-offset.  Thus if you
    like the general indentation levels, but you use 3 spaces instead
    of 4 spaces per level, you can probably achieve your style by just
    changing c-basic-offset like so (in your .emacs file):

    	(setq c-basic-offset 3)

    The offset value can also be a function, and this can really give
    power users a lot of flexibility in customizing indentation.

    As an example of how to customize indentation, lets change the
    style of example 2 above from:

    1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
    2: {
    3:     if( doit )
    4:         {
    5:             return( val + incr );
    6:         }
    7:     return( val );
    8: }

    to:

    1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
    2: {
    3:     if( doit )
    4:     {
    5:         return( val + incr );
    6:     }
    7:     return( val );
    8: }

    Since line 4 is the start of the construct we want to re-indent,
    we first move to that line and hit C-c C-s:

    	((block-open) (substatement . 46))

    So we know either want to change the indentation for `block-open',
    or for `substatement'.  Since the `substatement' syntactic symbol
    controls all indentation after if, else, while, do, switch, and
    for statements, and since we still want to indented non-block
    substatements like this:

	if( doit_again )
	    just_do_it();

    we decide to change the offset for `block-open'.  To do this
    interactively, just hit C-c C-o.  This prompts you for the
    syntactic symbol to change.  Enter "block-open" (without the
    double quotes) and hit return. It will then prompt you for the new
    offset value, with the old value as the default.  Hit backspace to
    delete the old value, then hit "-" (the minus sign) and then
    return.  This changes the offset to (-1 * c-basic-offset),
    essentially moving the construct one level of indentation to the
    left.

    To check your changes quickly, just hit C-c C-q to reindent the
    entire function.  If this does what you want, you can put the
    following lisp in your c-mode-common-hook (see below for an
    example):

    	(c-set-offset 'block-open 0)

    You could also set up a "style" that sets this and all your
    customizations in a convenient manner.  See the variable
    c-style-alist and the command c-set-style for more information, or
    take a look at the sample .emacs file below.
    

Frequently Asked Questions

    Q. How do I re-indent the whole file?
    A. Visit the file and hit "C-x h" to mark the whole buffer. Then
       hit "ESC C-\" to re-indent the entire region which you've just
       marked.

    Q. How do I re-indent the entire function? ESC C-x doesn't work
    A. ESC C-x is reserved for future Emacs use.  To re-indent the
       entire function hit C-c C-q.

    Q. How do I re-indent the current block?
    A. First move to the brace which opens the block with "ESC C-u",
       then re-indent that expression with "ESC C-q".

    Q. Why doesn't the RET key indent the line to where the new text
       should go after inserting the newline?
    A. Emacs' convention is that RET just add a new line, and that LFD
       adds a newline and indents.  You can make RET do this too by
       adding this to your c-mode-common-hook (see the sample .emacs
       file below):

       (define-key c-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)

       This is a very common question. :-)

    Q. I put (c-set-offset 'block-open 0) in my .emacs file and I get
       an error saying that c-set-offset's function definition is
       void.
    A. Since cc-mode is autoloaded, it is typically not loaded into
       your Emacs session by the time of the c-set-offset call.
       Instead of putting this in your top-level .emacs file, put the
       call to c-set-offset in your c-mode-common-hook.  See the
       sample .emacs file below for details.

User level differences between cc-mode.el and c++-mode.el 2.353 (a.k.a
cplus-md1.el in FSF 19):

    New Indentation Engine (described above).

    General rename of all variables and defuns from c++-<thing> to
    c-<thing>.  I don't list them all individually here.

    Direct support for C editing via defun `c-mode', and variables
    `c-mode-hook', `c-mode-abbrev-table', and `c-mode-map'.
    c++-c-mode is obsolete now.

    Menubar support (Emacs 19 only).

    New variables:
    	c-strict-semantics-p
	c-echo-semantic-information-p
	c-basic-offset
	c-offsets-alist
	c-style-alist

    New commands:
    	c-set-offset
	c-set-style
	c-fill-paragraph
	c-forward-into-nomenclature
	c-backward-into-nomenclature
	c-scope-operator
	c-beginning-of-statement
	c-end-of-statement
	c-up-conditional
	c-backward-conditional
	c-forward-conditional
	c-show-semantic-information

    Other renamed commands/variables:

For more information

    The best thing to do at this point is poke around the source code.
    Eventually there will be an extensive texinfo manual describing
    the mode in greater detail.


Requirements

    cc-mode.el requires reporter.el for submission of bug reports.
    reporter.el is distributed with the latest FSF and Lucid Emacs
    19's.  See below for Emacs Lisp Archive anonymous ftp'ing
    instructions for those of you who are using older Emacsen.


Limitations and Known Bugs

    c++-mode does not recognize exception constructs (will be fixed in
    next release).

    c++-mode does not recognize friend constructs (will be fixed in
    next release).

    there should be some way to indent the first statement in a block
    differently than the first statement in a defun (will be fixed in
    next release).

    re-indenting large regions or expressions can be slow (will be
    addressed in next release).

    Use with Emacs 18 can be slow and annoying. You should seriously
    consider upgrading to Emacs 19.

    If you don't put top-level function and class opening braces in
    column zero, you could notice severe degradations in performance.
    Consider changing your coding style or defining the variable
    defun-prompt-regexp to something suitable (Emacs 19 only).



Electronic Mail

    To report bugs, use the C-c C-b (c-submit-bug-report) command.
    This provides vital information I need to reproduce your problem.
    Make sure you include a stripped down code example.

    For other help or suggestions, send a message to
    cc-mode-help@anthem.nlm.nih.gov.

    To get on the beta testers list, send an add message to
    cc-mode-victims-request@anthem.nlm.nih.gov.  Note that this is a
    fairly technical discussion list so you should be moderately Emacs
    lisp fluent and have anonymous ftp access.

    There is also an announce only list where you will get beta
    version update diffs, but will not join in the technical
    discussions.  You should still have anon-ftp, and you shouldn't
    expect beta releases to be as stable as public releases.  Send an
    add message to cc-mode-announce-request@anthem.nlm.nih.gov to be
    added to this list.

    Please use these addresses instead of my personal address so I can
    keep track of all the incoming mail!
