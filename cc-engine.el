;; Moving by tokens, where a token is defined as all symbols and

;; direction.  A COUNT of 0 moves to the next token beginning only if
;; not already at one.  If BALANCED is true, move over balanced
;; parens, otherwise move into them.  Also, if BALANCED is true, never
;; move out of an enclosing paren.  LIM sets the limit for the
;; movement and defaults to the point limit.  Returns the number of

;; move over a balanced paren counts as one.  Note that if COUNT is 0
